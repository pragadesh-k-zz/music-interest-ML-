2)Clean the data.

3)Split the data into input and output.

4)Get the suitable algorithm for your usage which means based on the input and the way that you want to get your output

5)Training your algorithm by given the input.

6)Make the prediction..means ask the answer.

7)Evalute and improve (no machine will get accurate answer at the first time so find mistake and improve your machine ).

ALL THE BEST...For your ML :)
